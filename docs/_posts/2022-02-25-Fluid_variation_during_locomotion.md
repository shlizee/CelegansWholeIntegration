title: Varying fluid viscosity during locomotion 
---

<!--more-->

Experiments indicate that the environment plays a significant role in shaping coordinated movement. Here we explore environmental variations and their influence on _C. elegans_ locomotion with respect to parameters such as fluid viscosity. 

We compare the postures generated by the model to in-vivo experiments in which the **viscosity of the surrounding agar fluid** was altered by dropping a droplet of water (lower viscosity than agar). We mimic such an experiment by simulating the locomotion in two different viscosity values corresponding to either agar or water.

#### Changing fluid viscosity from agar (control) to water (low viscosity) - Experiment (Left), Model (Right)

We observe that for the control environment (agar), the model generates movement that features a “sine”-shaped posture qualitatively similar to that of the experiment, whereas for low viscosity (water) the same stimulation corresponds to extreme strokes in body postures, atypical to _C. elegans_ forward motion. When compared to experimental body curvatures in water, these postures have similar overall C-shaped postures as demonstrated in model video.
