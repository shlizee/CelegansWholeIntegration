Welocome to the blog of CelegansWholeIntegration! Here we will post videos of scenarios of _C. elegans_ locomotion studied using _CelegansWholeIntegration_ model. We will post scenarios reported in the mansucript and additional ones that we are obtaining with the model. With the blog we hope to create a **collection of scenarios together with experimental and computational community**. The collection will help enhance the model and potentially contribute to better understanding of mappping neural dynamics to body movements.

We will also notify here of anticipated code release **(its coming up soon!)** and notify regarding updates.
