# Welcome to _CelegansWholeIntegration_ Repository

_CelegansWholeIntegration_ is a whole nervous system and body model for _**C. elegans**_. The model simulates how connectome + neural interactions + body interact together to generate locomotion. 

We are working on releasing our code which will be entirely **open source**. The code repository will include the connectomics and simulation of neural dynamics, jointly called the nervous system module. In addition to the nervous system module we are releasing the body dynamics module. Both modules interface with each other and allow mutual simulation to close the loop between neural dynamics and body. The code will include an API for using independent components in the modules.

In the meantime please see our blog for locomotion scenarios + videos produced with _CelegansWholeIntegration_:

Also contact us with additional scenarios to explore, we would love to get suggestions!

Please note that the package requires diffeqpy package and Julia to be installed on your computer for efficient simulation. Please visit https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy for detailed instruction on installation.
